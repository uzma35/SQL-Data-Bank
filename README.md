**Project**: Data Bank Case Study (Data Science Bootcamp)

**Description**: There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.

Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data world…so he decided to launch a
new initiative - Data Bank!

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn’t only for banking activities, they also have the world’s most secure distributed data storage
platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting
caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team needs your help!

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their
customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyze their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their
future developments.
